## Introduction

CustomerServiceClassifierAI is an advanced research project exploring the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in classifying customer inquiries in the banking sector. This project employs experimental approaches with prompt-engineering and model fine-tuning techniques, aiming to enhance customer service through precise inquiry classification.

## Features

- Utilizes (BANKING77) a high-quality labeled dataset of banking customer inquiries to verify classification accuracy.
- Implements Zero-Shot and Few-Shot prompting to optimize response quality with no or minimal example inputs.
- Adjusts the LLM using specific dataset segments to increase the precision of model predictions.
- Uses standardized machine learning metrics to objectively assess prototype performance.
- Assesses the cost-effectiveness of the employed techniques.
- Used Models are OpenAIs GPT-3.5 Turbo.

## Objective:

The project aims to enhance customer interactions and provide strategic insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of LLMs in customer communication using cutting-edge AI technologies. It targets developers, researchers, and customer service professionals looking to innovate at the technology frontier.

## Results:

All Results can be found under the folder data/banking_results
