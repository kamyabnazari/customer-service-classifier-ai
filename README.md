# Project Name: CustomerServiceClassifierAI

## Description:

CustomerServiceClassifierAI is an advanced research project exploring the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in classifying customer inquiries in the banking sector. This project employs experimental approaches with cutting-edge prompt-engineering and model fine-tuning techniques, aiming to enhance customer service through precise inquiry classification.

## Key Features:

- **Data Preparation**: Utilizes a high-quality labeled dataset of banking customer inquiries to verify classification accuracy.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Implements Zero-Shot and Few-Shot prompting to optimize response quality with no or minimal example inputs.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Adjusts the LLM using specific dataset segments to increase the precision of model predictions.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Uses standardized machine learning metrics to objectively assess prototype performance.
- **Experimental Testing**: Conducts real-world tests to evaluate the effectiveness of developed methods in practical scenarios.
- **Cost Analysis**: Assesses the cost-effectiveness of the employed techniques.

## Technologies:

- OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo
- Python SDK

## Objective:

The project aims to enhance customer interactions and provide strategic insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of LLMs in customer communication using cutting-edge AI technologies. It targets developers, researchers, and customer service professionals looking to innovate at the technology frontier.
